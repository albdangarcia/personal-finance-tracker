/*
This middleware imports the configuration without the database adapter and creates its own Auth.js client. 
Note: Database functionality and support have been removed from next-auth in this middleware. 
      As a result, we canâ€™t fetch session details, user account information, etc., while executing code in the middleware.
      To protect your routes effectively, use checks on the front end files using const session = await auth(), !session, etc.
      Middleware will still handle extending the session cookie's expiry time.
